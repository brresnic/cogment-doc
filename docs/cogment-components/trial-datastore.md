### Low level gRPC API

The Trial Datastore implements two gRPC endpoints that is specified as part of the Cogment API:

-   [The DataLog API `LogExporter`](../cogment/cogment-low-level-api-guide/grpc.md#datalog-api)
-   [The Trial Datastore API `ModelRegistry`](../cogment/cogment-low-level-api-guide/grpc.md#trial-datastore-api) that defines how to create, retrieve, update and delete models and their version.
